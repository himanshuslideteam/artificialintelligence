The world is becoming more tech-dependent day by day. All thanks to the fourth industrial revolution in the information technology sector.  As several technologies emerge with different features and use, some are getting great hype due to their incredibility. Artificial intelligence is one of them.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of an object to perform human tasks like reasoning, understanding, learning, problem-solving, and decision making. In other words, it's how computer systems mimic humans; AI programs are designed for this exact purpose. The goal of AI isn't to create machines that can think like humans but rather to create computer programs that help us make better decisions and give us enhanced capabilities. It is a fascinating topic, and we cannot help but wonder how it will affect our lives in the future.
This advanced technology comes up with different aspects, and a particular way of learning is required to grasp those aspects properly.
